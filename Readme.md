# 🏛️ AI-Powered Legal Helper
### *Advancing the Indian Justice System with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)*

---

## 🌟 Overview
The **AI-Powered Legal Helper** is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to provide precise, context-aware answers to complex legal queries. By synthesizing information from vast legal databases—including the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the new Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)—the system empowers legal professionals with rapid research capabilities and assists citizens in navigating the complexities of the Indian justice system.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌐 Bilingual Statutory Querying
Submit queries in both **English and Hindi**. The system retrieves corresponding sections from the BNS and IPC with cross-linguistic accuracy, ensuring accessibility for a broader population.

### 🔄 Interactive Clause Comparison & Mapping
Side-by-side comparison of old **IPC sections** and their updated **BNS counterparts**. The system understands the specific mapping between the old and new laws.

### 🧠 Intelligent RAG Pipeline
Utilizes a sophisticated retrieval system that:
- Searches multiple legal collections simultaneously (IPC, BNS, Mapping).
- Ranks results by semantic relevance.
- Generates context-aware answers.

### 🔗 Verifiable Source Footnoting
Every statement generated by the AI is grounded in retrieved legal documents, reducing hallucinations and ensuring verifiability.

## 🛠️ Architecture: How it Works
The system utilizes a state-of-the-art **RAG Pipeline**:

1.  **Ingestion & Parsing:** Custom PDF parsers extract structured data (sections, chapters) from official gazettes and raw text files. We handle complex formatting and Hindi OCR.
2.  **Vector Store (ChromaDB):** Legal text is converted into high-dimensional vector embeddings and stored in dedicated collections (`ipc`, `bns`, `mapping`).
3.  **FastAPI Backend:** An async, high-performance API routes queries to the vector store.
4.  **Retrieval:** The system searches across collections to find relevant laws and their old/new equivalents.
5.  **Generation:** The context is assembled and presented to the user (LLM integration ready).

## 💻 Development Setup

This project consists of a **FastAPI** backend (Python) and a **React** frontend.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js & npm
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (Recommended for fast Python setup)

### 2. Backend Setup
The backend serves the RAG API and runs on port `5000`.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Or using standard pip: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`)*

2.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    uv run python backend/main.py
    ```
    The server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
    - Swagger Documentation: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs`

3.  **(Optional) Re-Ingest Data:**
    If you need to rebuild the database:
    ```bash
    uv run python scripts/ingest_data.py --ipc --bns
    uv run python scripts/ingest_mapping.py
    ```

### 3. Frontend Setup
The frontend is the user interface and runs on port `5173`.

1.  Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 4. How to Use
1.  Ensure **Backend** is running.
2.  Open **Frontend** in browser.
3.  Navigate to the Chat page.
4.  Ask questions like:
    - *"What is Section 302?"*
    - *"What is the punishment for mob lynching?"*
    - *"Compare IPC vs BNS for theft."*
