# 🏛️ AI-Powered Legal Helper
### *Advancing the Indian Justice System with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)*

---

## 🌟 Overview
The **AI-Powered Legal Helper** is an advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to provide precise, context-aware answers to complex legal queries. By synthesizing information from vast legal databases—including the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the new Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)—the system empowers legal professionals with rapid research capabilities and assists citizens in navigating the complexities of the Indian justice system.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🌐 Bilingual Statutory Querying
Submit queries in both **English and Hindi**. The system retrieves corresponding sections from the BNS and IPC with cross-linguistic accuracy, ensuring accessibility for a broader population.

### 📑 Automated Case Law Cross-Referencing
Automatically identifies and presents landmark **Supreme Court and High Court judgments** relevant to the retrieved legal sections, providing a comprehensive legal perspective.

### 🔄 Interactive Clause Comparison
Side-by-side comparison of old **IPC sections** and their updated **BNS counterparts**. Track changes in legislative wording, definitions, and penalties with ease.

### 🛡️ Multi-Jurisdictional Regulatory Filtering
Refine searches by specific domains such as:
- **Corporate Law**
- **Information Technology (IT) Acts**
- **Environmental Regulations**
Ensures domain-specific accuracy and relevance.

### 🔗 Verifiable Source Footnoting
Every statement generated by the AI includes **precise, clickable citations**. These links lead directly to official government gazettes or digitized statute documents, ensuring 100% verifiability.

### 📄 Legal Document Summarization
Upload dense legal documents or lengthy court orders. The tool extracts:
- **Core Arguments**
- **Final Verdicts**
- **Specific Acts/Sections cited**

## 🛠️ Architecture: How it Works
The system utilizes a state-of-the-art **RAG Pipeline**:

1.  **Ingestion:** Scrapes and parses official Indian legal databases (Gazettes, Statutes).
2.  **Indexing:** Converts legal text into high-dimensional vector embeddings stored in a vector database.
3.  **Retrieval:** When a user asks a query, the system finds the most relevant clauses and precedents.
4.  **Generation:** A Large Language Model (LLM) synthesizes the retrieved information into a clear, concise, and accurate response.
5.  **Verification:** Cross-references the response with the original documents to provide footnotes.

## 💻 Development Setup

This project consists of a **Flask** backend (Python) and a **React** frontend (Vite + Tailwind CSS).

### 1. Backend Setup
The backend serves the API and runs on port `5000`.

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment (if not already active):
   - Windows: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Mac/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Server will start at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup
The frontend is the user interface and runs on port `5173`.

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Access the app at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 3. Connecting Them
The frontend is configured to fetch data from `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Ensure the backend is running before using the frontend.
